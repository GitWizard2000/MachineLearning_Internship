# MachineLearning_Internship

This repository contains the project that I worked on during one of my colleage internships.

It was a Machine Learning project.

Description of the project is as following:

- Predicted Ad view counts on YouTube videos using an Excel dataset of 15K+ entries with 9 predictive features
- Applied and evaluated multiple regression models; Random Forest Regressor achieved a minimum MAE of 3.12K
- Improved model performance by introducing an Artificial Neural Network, reducing MAE by 45% compared to RFR
